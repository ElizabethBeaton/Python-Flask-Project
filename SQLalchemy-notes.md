SQLalchemy is an Object Relatioal Mapper (ORM)
- SQLalchemy is a Python library used for interacting with relational databases
- allows developers to map Python classes to database tables.
- it allows you to work with database records as Python objects, abstracting away the need to write SQL queries directly
- the ORM handles the conversion between Python objects and SQL tables behind the scenes
- SQLalchemy provides a lower-level interface (Core) for writing SQL queries in a pythonic way
- its a tool/framework to help interact with databases from Python code, abstracting SQL code and making database operations easier and more flexible
